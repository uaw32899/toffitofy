In the first week of July, I met a girl. Her name is Jessica. To tell you the truth, I really like her, so I spent all my pocket money on cinemas and cafés. She likes rock music and so do I.
We went to a Metallica concert. It was incredible, there were so many people and the music was so loud. After that, I thought that I could not hear anything. We bought a pair of bracelets, so we will remember this day forever.
At the end of July, my parents and I decided to go hiking. Jessica did not like it but I did, so we packed our stuff and went to the nearest route.
It was a hard journey but also very fun. My brother took a guitar. I am crazy about spending evenings next to the campfire playing guitar and telling scary stories.
After a few days, we were exhausted but satisfied. After we came home, we slept for the whole day.
In August, I decided to earn some money. My dad offered me to work for him; he has a small café and needed a waiter. It was not really well paid but also not hard. 
I was saving money for my car upgrade; I cannot wait to go to school in my own car. I am sure all my classmates will be jealous. Furthermore, 
I introduced Jessica to my friends, and they got along. We hung out together for the whole of August. 
When I got my salary, I upgraded my car, so it looked incredible. I hope the school year will be better than the previous one.
